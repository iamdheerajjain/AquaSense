# 🌊 AquaSense: Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

> A smart ML-based system to predict water potability based on chemical properties — trained on real-world environmental data. Built with scikit-learn, pandas, and Matplotlib.

---

## 📊 Overview

This project uses machine learning to classify whether a given water sample is **safe for drinking** (potable) or **unsafe** based on various chemical and physical features.

🔍 **Target**: `is_potable`  
🧠 **Model**: Random Forest Classifier  
📁 **Input Format**: CSV file with water quality features  
📈 **Output**: Trained model, evaluation report, and feature importance plot
